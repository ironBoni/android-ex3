  * Click on a contact and you will see the chat with him.

The client can send and receive message from other clients that are 
registered in the server. Furthermore, the android client can send and receive message from 
react client (react - exercise 2 - https://github.com/ironBoni/asp-chat)

The application saves local DB (Room) - for chats, contacts, etc.
