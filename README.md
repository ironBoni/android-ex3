To open the Server's code - 
Clone and **Go to the Main folder, and open Main.sln**.

**Database - Migrations, Load Data**<br/>
(Install MariaDB with the password Np1239, the password is defined in ItemsContext.cs). <br/>

Please make sure that "pomelodb" doesn't exist as database in the MariaDB (Otherwise, drop it). <br/>
It can be done via HeidiSQL (as mentioned below).

1. run in the Packange Manager Console the commands: 
  * add-migration init <br/>
  * update-database <br/>
  
2. Load data - Open HeidiSQL (in Windows):
  * username: root
  * password: Np1239
  * port: 3306
  * Click Open
  * In the HeidiSQL - Click on File -> Run SQL File 
  * Choose the file in Database\Final_DeleteAndInsert.sql (In the popup, click Yes).
  
  Now all the data is loaded to the DB.
<br/>

**Run the server** <br/>
In Main/Main.sln, <br/>
Set as startup project (the "AspWebApi"), and Start without Debugging.

  (if the didn't choose the image, it will be the default).
* Press **register**.

**Login:**<br/>

  but you can enter the userId you registered with).
* Enter password. (Np1234).
* Press Login.

**Contacts List - Main Activity**
The first item in the view is the logged-in user <br/>
So, from the second item and on it's all his contacts. <br/>

    Server - localhost:5186 <br/>
* Click on ADD CONTACT.
  (If you will scroll down to the bottom you will see the new contact).

**Firebase**
* To simulate it, open Postman (or react client from execrise 2 - the react is in the react repository folder).
* Assuming that you loaded the DB Data as mentioned, and "noam" appears in ron's contacts
  (Otherwise, add it to the contacts).
  
* In the Postman, send Transfer:
  POST to http://localhost:5186/api/transfer/
  with the body:
  {
  "from": "noam",
  "to": "ron",
  "content": "Good morning!!!"
  }
    
* You can notice you got notification in 3 ways: <br/>
  * A notification if you scroll down the bar.
    ("New message: from noam", "Good Morning!!").
  * An update in the last message in the contacts list. 
  * An update in the conversation activity (if you click on Noam, you will see the 
    last message is what that was sent by the firebase).
    
**Landscape screens**
* Go the the Contacts List (The main activity, that shows all the contacts).
* Enable rotating the phone in the bar above (2 buttons right to the Wi-Fi button)
* In the emulator click on Rotate Right.
* Give it a few seconds.
* Now the screen shows both the contacts, and the relevant chat in the same activity.
* Click on a contact and you will see the chat with him.
